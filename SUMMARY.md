# LeetCode Company Finder Extension - Project Summary

## What Was Built

A complete Chrome extension (Manifest V3) that enhances LeetCode problem pages by showing company-frequency data. The extension provides a floating icon on the left side of LeetCode problem pages that, when clicked, opens a panel displaying which companies have asked that specific problem and how frequently.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Floating Icon**: Circular icon positioned on the left side of LeetCode problem pages
- **Company Panel**: Expandable panel showing companies and frequency data
- **Data Fetching**: Fetches data from GitHub raw files with Netlify fallback
- **Local Caching**: 24-hour cache to improve performance
- **Problem Identification**: Robust slug extraction from URLs and page content

### ✅ User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Dark Mode Support**: Adapts to LeetCode's dark theme
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions for panel interactions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full accessibility support
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues and missing data

### ✅ Technical Implementation
- **Manifest V3**: Modern Chrome extension architecture
- **Content Script**: Main functionality injected into LeetCode pages
- **Background Service Worker**: Handles extension lifecycle and caching
- **Chrome Storage API**: Local data persistence
- **Promise-based Fetching**: Robust network requests

## Data Sources

The extension fetches data from:
1. **Primary**: GitHub raw files from [Leetcode-Company-Wise-Questions-Website](https://github.com/farneet24/Leetcode-Company-Wise-Questions-Website)
2. **Fallback**: Netlify site when GitHub is unavailable
3. **Local Cache**: 24-hour cache to reduce network requests

## Installation Instructions

### Quick Install
1. Download `leetcode-company-finder.zip`
2. Extract to a folder
3. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode"
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder
6. Visit any LeetCode problem page to test

### Testing
- **Two Sum**: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
- **Add Two Numbers**: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/
- **Valid Parentheses**: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/

## Technical Highlights

### Problem Identification Strategy
1. **URL Parsing**: Extract slug from `/problems/<slug>/` path
2. **DOM Elements**: Look for problem title in page elements
3. **Page Title**: Fallback to parsing document title
4. **Slugification**: Convert titles to URL-friendly slugs

### Data Matching Logic
- Searches through `preprocessed_companies.json` by problem title
- Falls back to `problem_data.json` for problem metadata
- Handles both slug-based and ID-based lookups

### Caching Strategy
- **Duration**: 24 hours
- **Storage**: `chrome.storage.local`
- **Keys**: `companiesData`, `problemData`, `lastCacheTime`
- **Refresh**: Manual refresh button in panel

## Testing Results

All automated tests pass:
- ✅ URL slug extraction (8/8 tests)
- ✅ Title slugification (5/5 tests)
- ✅ Data matching logic
- ✅ Error handling scenarios

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Primary target (Manifest V3)
- **Edge**: Compatible (Chromium-based)
- **Other Chromium browsers**: Should work with Manifest V3 support

## Security & Privacy

- **No user data collection**: Only reads current page URL
- **Local processing**: All data processing happens locally
- **Minimal permissions**: Only necessary host permissions
- **No telemetry**: No external tracking or analytics

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Settings panel for user preferences
- Company logos in the company list
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Export functionality for personal use
- Statistics dashboard
- Bookmark integration

### Technical Improvements
- Service worker caching strategies
- Background sync for data updates
- Performance optimizations
- Offline support
- Enhanced accessibility

## Project Status

✅ **Complete**: All core functionality implemented and tested
✅ **Documented**: Comprehensive README and installation guides
✅ **Packaged**: Ready for distribution as ZIP file
✅ **Tested**: Automated tests and manual testing scenarios

## Usage Example

1. User visits https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
2. Floating icon appears on left side of page
3. User clicks icon to open company panel
4. Panel shows:
   - Problem title: "Two Sum"
   - Companies: Amazon (2.5 times all time), Google (1.8 times all time)
   - Time-based breakdowns available
5. User can click companies to visit their pages
6. User can refresh data or open main site

## Support
